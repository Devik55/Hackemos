### READ BEFORE USING
I am not responsible for any damages caused by using this script, as it serves as a proof of concept of the insecurities of the site and how they can be exploited. This is not intended for academic dishonesty. The menu is open sourced and is avaliable in the src folder for easy patching. (i also made this so i can have an excuse to practice making uis)

### How to Get Started  
1. Copy this code:
 ```javascript
   javascript:fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Devik55/Hackemos/refs/heads/main/src/latest.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(eval);
```
3. Open the bookmarks bar (press `Ctrl+Shift+B`).  
4. Make a new bookmark on your bookmarks bar.  
5. Right-click the bookmark and select **Edit**.  
6. Delete the current URL in the bookmark and replace it with the code.  
7. Save the bookmark and click it while on an assignment.  
8. Done! ðŸŽ‰  

Alternatively, you can go to the `src` folder and paste the newest version into the dev console, but note that this method doesnâ€™t auto-update.
